# NC Extra Ingot Blocks!

## What is this?
The NC Extra Ingot Blocks aims to add via Content and CraftTweaker block forms of ingots in NuclearCraft and NuclearCraft: Overhauled, that are missing from the base mod.
For both NC versions, all 16 alloys receive a block form, and in underhaul/pre-overhaul NC, Manganese Oxide and Manganese Dioxide blocks are also added.
Go to the Releases tab to download the addon for your NuclearCraft version.

2. Place the ZenScript (.zs) files from the scripts folder in your instance's scripts folder.
3. Open the resources/contenttweaker folder.
4. Take all of the files in the blockstates folder, and move them in your instance's blockstates folder.
5. Go to the lang folder, open the lang file and copy the text inside, then paste the contents in the en_US.lang file of your instance's lang folder.
Note: If there is no en_US.lang file in your instance's folder, just copy the file and paste it.
