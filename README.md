## What is this?
The NC Extra Ingot Blocks aims to add via Content and CraftTweaker block forms of ingots in NuclearCraft and NuclearCraft: Overhauled, that are missing from the base mod.
For both NC versions, all 16 alloys receive a block form, and in underhaul/pre-overhaul NC, Manganese Oxide and Manganese Dioxide blocks are also added (which are missing
from the base mod)
